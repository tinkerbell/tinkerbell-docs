# Hegel

GitHub repository: [tinkerbell/hegel](https://github.com/tinkerbell/hegel).

Hegel is Tinkerbell's metadata store, supporting storage and retrieval of metadata over gRPC and HTTP. It also provides a compatible layer with the AWS EC2 metadata format.

Metadata is user-defined as part of the hardware data that makes up a workflow.

## Using Hegel

You can access Hegel in a Tinkerbell setup at the Provisioner's IP address `/metadata`. You can use cURL to retrieve the metadata it stores.

Hegel by default exposes an `HTTP` API on port `50061`. You can interact with it
via cURL

```
curl <hegel_ip>:50061/metadata
```

You can also retrieve a AWS EC2 compatible format uses from `/meta-data`.

```
$ curl <hegel_ip>:50061/<date>/meta-data
```

For example, if you are using the [Vagrant Setup](/setup/local-vagrant/), Hegel runs as part of the Provisioner virtual machine with the IP: `192.168.1.1`. When the Worker starts and if you have logged in to [osie](/services/osie) using the password `root` you can access the metadata for your server via `cURL`:

```
curl -s 192.168.1.1:50061/metadata | jq .
>
{
    "facility": {
        "facility_code": "onprem"
    },
    "instance": {},
    "state": ""
}
```

Or in AWS EC2 format:

```
curl -s 192.168.1.1:50061/2009-04-04/meta-data
```

If you look at the `hardware-data.json` that we used during the Vagrant setup you will find the `facility_code=onprem` as well.

## Other Resources

Every cloud provider is capable of exposing metadata to servers that you can query as part of your automation, usually via HTTP. Some examples:

- [AWS: Instance metadata and user data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html)
- [GCP: Storing and retrieving instance metadata](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/storing-retrieving-metadata)
