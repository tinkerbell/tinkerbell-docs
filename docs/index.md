# The Tinkerbell Docs

Everything you need to know about Tinkerbell and its major component microservices.
​
## What is Tinkerbell?

Tinkerbell is an open-source, bare metal provisioning engine, built and maintained by the team at Equinix Metal.

## What's Powering Tinkerbell?

The Tinkerbell stack consists of several microservices, and a grpc API: 

- [**Tink**](https://github.com/tinkerbell/tink) - Tink is the short-hand name for the [`tink-server`](/services/tink-server), [`tink-worker`](/services/tink-worker), and [`tink-cli`](/services/tink-cli). `tink-worker` and `tink-server` communicate over gRPC, and are responsible for processing workflows. The CLI is the user-interactive piece for creating workflows and their building blocks, templates and hardware data.

- [**Boots**](/services/boots) - Boots is Tinkerbell's DHCP server. It handles DHCP requests, hands out IPs, and serves up [iPXE](https://ipxe.org/). It uses the Tinkerbell client to pull and push hardware data. It only responds to a predefined set of MAC addresses so it can be deployed in an existing network without interfering with existing DHCP infrastructure.

- [**Hegel**](/services/hegel) - Hegel is the metadata service used by Tinkerbell and OSIE. It collects data from both and transforms it into a JSON format to be consumed as metadata.

- [**OSIE**](/services/osie) - OSIE is Tinkerbell's default an in-memory installation environment for bare metal. It installs operating systems and handles deprovisioning.

- [**Hook**](https://github.com/tinkerbell/hook#hook) - An alternative to OSIE, it's the next iteration of the in-memory installation environment to handle operating system installation and deprovisioning.

- [**PBnJ**](https://github.com/tinkerbell/pbnj) - PBnJ is an optional microservice that can communicate with baseboard management controllers (BMCs) to control power and boot settings.

In addition to the microservices, there are three pieces of infrastructure:

- [**PostgreSQL**](https://www.postgresql.org/) - Tinkerbell uses PostgreSQL as its data store. PostgreSQL is a free and open-source relational database management system, and it stores Tinkerbell's hardware data, templates, and workflows.

- [**Image Repository**](https://hub.docker.com/_/registry) - Tinkerbell uses a local image repository to store all of the action images used in a workflow. This is particularly useful for secure environments that don't have access to the internet. You can also choose to use [Quay](https://quay.io/) or [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/) as the repository to store images for if your environment does have internet access.

- [**NGINX**](https://www.nginx.com/) - NGINX is a web server which can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy, and HTTP cache. Tinkerbell uses NGINX to serve the required boot files and OS images during workflow execution.


## First Steps

​New to Tinkerbell or bare metal provisioning? This is a great place to start!

- Getting Started - Set up Tinkerbell [locally with vagrant](/setup/local-vagrant/) or on [Equinix Metal with Terraform](/setup/equinix-metal-terraform/).
- Run [hello world](workflows/hello-world-workflow) to see Tinkerbell in action.​
