# Deploying FreeBSD

This is a guide which walks through the process of deploying FreeBSD from an operating system image.

## Getting the Image

FreeBSD distributes their Operating System in a number of different formats, which are all available on the `cloud-images` web site [https://download.freebsd.org/ftp/releases/VM-IMAGES/12.2-RELEASE/amd64/Latest/](https://download.freebsd.org/ftp/releases/VM-IMAGES/12.2-RELEASE/amd64/Latest/). 

Below are two examples of images we can use:

```
FreeBSD-12.2-RELEASE-amd64.qcow2.xz	599212960	2020-Oct-23 06:27
FreeBSD-12.2-RELEASE-amd64.raw.xz	600337912	2020-Oct-23 06:44
```

Both images come with compressed with the `xz` compression format, you will need to decompress them with the `xz` command.

```
xz -d <file.xz>
```

The `raw` image is a disk image which ontains a full partition table (including OS and Swap partition) and boot loader for our FreeBSD system. You can examine this with `losetup`.

```
$ losetup -f -P ./FreeBSD-12.2-RELEASE-amd64.raw 

$ fdisk -l /dev/loop1

Disk /dev/loop1: 5 GiB, 5369587712 bytes, 10487476 sectors
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disklabel type: gpt
Disk identifier: 2346CB62-14FB-11EB-9C6B-0CC47AD8B808

Device         Start      End Sectors  Size Type
/dev/loop1p1       3      113     111 55.5K FreeBSD boot
/dev/loop1p2     114     1713    1600  800K EFI System
/dev/loop1p3    1714  2098865 2097152    1G FreeBSD swap
/dev/loop1p4 2098866 10487473 8388608    4G FreeBSD UFS
```

The `raw` image comes with everything that we will need to install and deploy FreeBSD.

The other image, with the extension `.qcow2.xz` is a compressed `qcow2` filesystem image and is a **full** disk image including partition tables, partitions filled with filesystems and files, and importantly, a boot loader at the beginning of the disk image. However, if you want to use the `qcow` image you will have to convert it with the `qemu-img` CLI tool.

```
apt-get install -y qemu-utils
```

Then use the tool to convert the image into a `raw` filesystem.

```
qemu-img convert  ./FreeBSD-12.2-RELEASE-amd64.qcow2 -O raw ./FreeBSD-12.2-RELEASE-amd64.raw
```

Once you have a `raw` filesystem image, you can optionally compress the raw image to save on both local disk space and network bandwidth when deploying the image.

```
gzip ./FreeBSD-12.2-RELEASE-amd64.raw
```

The raw image will need to live at a locally accessible web server. To simplify, you can place the image in the Tinkerbell sandbox webroot, which allows access to the image at the IP address of the tink-server. 

```
mv ./FreeBSD-12.2-RELEASE-amd64.raw.gz ./sandbox/deploy/state/webroot
```

## Creating the Template

The template uses actions from the [artifact.io](https://artifact.io) hub.

- [image2disk](https://artifacthub.io/packages/tbaction/tinkerbell-community/image2disk) - to write the image to a block device.
- [kexec](https://artifacthub.io/packages/tbaction/tinkerbell-community/kexec) - to `kexec` into our newly provisioned operating system. 

> Important: Don't forget to pull, tag and push `quay.io/tinkerbell-actions/image2disk:v1.0.0` prior to using it.
