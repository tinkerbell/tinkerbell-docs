# Deploying Debian

This guide walks through the process of deploying Debian through:

- an Operating System Image
- a Docker Image
- Bootstrap

## Using an Operating System Image

Debian distributes their Operating System in a number of different formats, which are all available on the `cloud-images` web site: [https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/cloud/OpenStack/current/](https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/cloud/OpenStack/current/). 

Below are two examples of images we can use:

```
debian-10-openstack-amd64.qcow2	   2021-03-04 10:56	  577M
debian-10-openstack-amd64.raw	      2021-03-04 10:53	  2.0G
```

The first image is a `qcow2` filesystem image and is a **full** disk image including partition tables, partitions filled with filesystems and files, and importantly, a boot loader at the beginning of the disk image. If you use the `qcow2` image, you will need to convert it into a `raw` image by installing the `qemu-img` cli tool,

```
apt-get install -y qemu-utils
```

and using it to convert the image into a `raw` filesystem.

```
qemu-img convert  ./debian-10-openstack-amd64.qcow2 -O raw ./debian-10-openstack-amd64.raw
```

The second image is already a `raw` disk image which can be used as-is because it contains everything that we need to boot directly into Debian.

**Optional** - You can compress the raw image to save on both local disk space and network bandwidth when deploying the image.

```
gzip ./debian-10-openstack-amd64.raw
```

The raw image will need to live at a locally accessible web server. To simplify, you can place the image in the Tinkerbell sandbox webroot, which allows access to the image at the IP address of the `tink-server`.

```
mv ./debian-10-openstack-amd64.raw.gz ./sandbox/deploy/state/webroot
```

### Creating the Template

The template uses actions from the [artifact.io](https://artifact.io) hub.

- [image2disk](https://artifacthub.io/packages/tbaction/tinkerbell-community/image2disk) - to write the OS image to a block device.
- [kexec](https://artifacthub.io/packages/tbaction/tinkerbell-community/kexec) - to `kexec` into our newly provisioned operating system. 

```
version: "0.1"
name: debian_Focal
global_timeout: 1800
tasks:
  - name: "os-installation"
	worker: "{{.device_1}}"
	volumes:
	  - /dev:/dev
	  - /dev/console:/dev/console
	  - /lib/firmware:/lib/firmware:ro
	actions:
	  - name: "stream debian image"
		image: quay.io/tinkerbell-actions/image2disk:v1.0.0
		timeout: 600
		environment:
		  DEST_DISK: /dev/sda
		  IMG_URL: "http://192.168.1.1:8080/debian-10-openstack-amd64.raw.gz"
		  COMPRESSED: true
	  - name: "kexec debian"
		image: quay.io/tinkerbell-actions/kexec:v1.0.0
		timeout: 90
		pid: host
		environment:
		  BLOCK_DEVICE: /dev/sda1
			FS_TYPE: ext4
```

## Using a Docker Image

We can easily make use of the **official** docker images to generate a root filesystem for use when deploying with Tinkerbell.

### Downloading the Image

```
TMPRFS=$(docker container create debian:latest)
docker export $TMPRFS > debian_rootfs.tar
docker rm $TMPRFS
```

**Optional** - You can compress the raw image to save on both local disk space and network bandwidth when deploying the image.

```
gzip ./debian_rootfs.tar
```

The raw image will need to live at a locally accessible web server. To simplify, you can place the image in the Tinkerbell sandbox webroot, which allows access to the image at the IP address of the `tink-server`. 

```
mv ./debian_rootfs.tar.gz ./sandbox/deploy/state/webroot
```

### Creating the Template

The template uses actions from the [artifact.io](https://artifact.io) hub.

- [rootio](https://artifacthub.io/packages/tbaction/tinkerbell-community/rootio) - to partition our disk and make filesystems.
- [archive2disk](https://artifacthub.io/packages/tbaction/tinkerbell-community/archive2disk) - to write the OS image to a block device.
- [cexec](https://artifacthub.io/packages/tbaction/tinkerbell-community/cexec) - to run commands inside (chroot) our newly provisioned operating system.
- [kexec](https://artifacthub.io/packages/tbaction/tinkerbell-community/kexec) - to `kexec` into our newly provisioned operating system. 

```

tasks:
  - name: "os-installation"

	  - /dev/console:/dev/console

		image: quay.io/tinkerbell-actions/kexec:v1.0.0
		timeout: 600
		environment:
		  BLOCK_DEVICE: /dev/sda3
		  FS_TYPE: ext4
```

## Using Bootstrap

The final method for installing Debian is to use the [grml-debootstrap](https://grml.org/grml-debootstrap/) installer. We will need to create an action that will invoke the installer and install to our local disk.

### Creating the Dockerfile

The `dockerfile` creates a new image based upon Debian, installs all of the components needed for `grml-debootstrap`. Then, it sets the `ENTRYPOINT` to execute the `grml-debootstrap` program to install to Debian to `/dev/sda3` and install the boot-loader to `/dev/sda`.

```
FROM debian:bullseye
RUN apt-get update; apt-get install -y grml-debootstrap
ENTRYPOINT ["grml-debootstrap", "--target", "/dev/sda3", "--grub", "/dev/sda"]
```

Now create an action image from our Dockerfile.

```
docker build -t local-registry/debian:example .
```

Once the new action is pushed to the local registry, it can be used as an action in a template.

```
actions:
- name: "expand ubuntu filesystem to root"
  image: local-registry/debian:bootstrap
  timeout: 90
```

### Creating the Template

The template uses actions from the [artifact.io](https://artifact.io) hub.

- [rootio](https://artifacthub.io/packages/tbaction/tinkerbell-community/rootio) - to partition our disk and make filesystems
- Our custom action that will invoke the Bootstrap program.
- [kexec](https://artifacthub.io/packages/tbaction/tinkerbell-community/kexec) - to `kexec` into our newly provisioned operating system.

As well as the `debian:bootstrap` action from the local registry.

```
version: "0.1"
name: debian_bullseye_provisioning
global_timeout: 1800
tasks:
  - name: "os-installation"
	worker: "{{.device_1}}"
	volumes:
	  - /dev:/dev
	  - /dev/console:/dev/console
	  - /lib/firmware:/lib/firmware:ro
	actions:
	  actions:
	  - name: "disk-wipe-partition"
		image: quay.io/tinkerbell-actions/rootio:v1.0.0
		timeout: 90
		command: ["partition"]
		environment:
			MIRROR_HOST: 192.168.1.2
	  - name: "format"
		image: quay.io/tinkerbell-actions/rootio:v1.0.0
		timeout: 90
		command: ["format"]
		environment:
			MIRROR_HOST: 192.168.1.2
	  - name: "expand ubuntu filesystem to root"
		image: local-registry/debian:bootstrap
		timeout: 90
	  - name: "kexec-debian"
	    image: quay.io/tinkerbell-actions/kexec:v1.0.0
	    timeout: 600
	    environment:
	        BLOCK_DEVICE: /dev/sda3
	        FS_TYPE: ext4
```
