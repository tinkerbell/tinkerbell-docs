# Troubleshooting

The following are possible errors you might run into and their possible solutions:

- If you are on Packet environment and the worker is not set to always PXE, then you may encounter the following error.
  The issue can be resolved by setting the worker to always PXE from the server actions dropdown.

```
PowerEdge R6415 - BIOS 1.8.7
A system restart is required. The system detected an exception during the UEFI
pre-boot environment.
```

- On a provisioner, the registry login can fail with the error below.
  This is generally because the `/certs/ca.pem` file (generated by certs container) is not copied to `/etc/docker/certs.d/<registry-host>/ca.crt`.
  If the error occurs on a worker, then verify if the certificate file is present at `/var/tinkerbell/nginx/workflow/ca.pem` location on the provisioner.

```
Login did not succeed, error: Error response from daemon: Get https://<registry-host>/v2/: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority (possibly because of "crypto/rsa: verification error" while trying to verify candidate authority certificate "Autogenerated CA")
```
