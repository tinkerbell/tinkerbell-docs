The projects are designed to be as independent as possible, some are ready, others have a long way to go, but in general it really depend on what you are working at.

My advice is to figure out a way to cut your contribution in a way that is self contained for a single repository. This is a good practice because it simplifies the development but it also forces us to avoid breaking changes. At this current stage we are far from out first stable release, it means that it is a perfect time to actually have breaking changes, you can read more about [this topic at the proposal ](https://github.com/tinkerbell/proposals/blob/master/proposals/0011/README.md).

We think every developer has its own tool chain and mindset when it comes to development environment and we can't have one that works for every developer.

The idea here is to collect and share the various ways we develop Tinkerbell in order to share practical tips or to serve as inspiration for contributing to the project.
