If you are you are properly interested in contributing to Tinkerbell and we are thankful for that.

Tinkerbell is an open source project made of different components, a lot of the code is written in Go but it is not the only way to make a contribution obviously we use and rely on a lot of different technologies such as: iPXE, Docker, Promethues, Kubernetes, Golang and much more.

I am sure you will be able to find what you are looking for, the best way to start here is to join Slack if you want or the Contributor Mailing list, you can find more about this topic in the ["COMMUNICATION page"](https://github.com/tinkerbell/.github/blob/master/COMMUNICATION.md#contributors-mailing-list).

You can find all our projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/tinkerbell), have a look at issues and pull requests and if you can't figure out anything you want to do let's ping us on Slack.

Currently we are doing a lot of work around:

* CI/CD not only for our projects but also for the reusable actions we ship to [ArtifactHub](https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?page=1&org=tinkerbell-community), you can find them to [tinkerbell/hub](https://github.com/tinkerbell/hub).
* We are refactoring our Go binaries to be friendly and flexible using Cobra, Viber.
* We have to write an end to end test framework that we can use to test the entire project in integration
* Documentation, documentation, documentation!
